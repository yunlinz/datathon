expenses, minus the average grant/scholarship aid. It is calculated for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is included in the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For public institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram), this represents the net price for the full program. This metric is not available prior to the 2009-10 academic year."Average net price for Title IV institutions (private for-profit and nonprofit institutions),integer,NPT4_PRIV,,,IPEDS,Shown/used on consumer website;In-state tuition and fees,integer,TUITIONFEE_IN,,,IPEDS,Out-of-state tuition and fees,integer,TUITIONFEE_OUT,,,IPEDS,Average faculty salary,integer,AVGFACSAL,,,IPEDS,"Average faculty salary per month, calculated from the IPEDS Human Resources component. This metric is calculated as the total salary outlays divided by the number of months worked for all full-time nonmedical instructional staff. Prior to the 2011-12 academic year, when months worked were reported in groups, the value for 9-10 months is estimated as 9.5 months and the value for 11-12 months is estimated as 11.5 months. Values prior to the 2003-04 academic year are limited to degree-granting institutions for consistency with values in subsequent academic years.""Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)",float,C150_4,,,IPEDS,"The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate at the institution within 150 percent of normal time, calculated from the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.
